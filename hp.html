                            Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. 
                            <br><br>Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt 
                            and uncle. Then, on Harry’s eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some 
                            astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
                            An incredible adventure is about to begin!

                            and rescue from the Dursleys by his friend Ron Weasley in a magical flying car! <br><br>
                            Back at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft And Wizardry for his second year, Harry hears strange whispers echo through empty 
                            corridors – and then the attacks start. Students are found as though turned to stone … Dobby’s sinister predictions seem 
                            to be coming true.

                            <br><br> Sirius Black, escaped mass-murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort, is on the run –
                             and they say he is coming after Harry. In his first ever Divination class, Professor 
                             Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry’s tea leaves … But perhaps most terrifying of all are
                              the Dementors patrolling the school grounds, with their soul-sucking kiss …

                            The Triwizard Tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. Only wizards who are over seventeen are allowed to enter –
                             but that doesn’t stop Harry dreaming that he will win the competition. <br><br>
                             Then at Hallowe’en, when the Goblet of Fire makes its selection, Harry is amazed to find his name is one of 
                             those that the magical cup picks out. He will face death-defying tasks, dragons and Dark wizards,
                              but with the help of his best friends, Ron and Hermione, he might just make it through – alive!

                            Harry Potter knows that Voldemort will stop at nothing to find him. There are many who deny the Dark Lord’s return,
                             but Harry is not alone: a secret Order gathers at Grimmauld Place to fight against the Dark forces. 
                             <br><br> Harry must allow Professor Snape to teach him how to protect himself from Voldemort’s savage assaults 
                             on his mind. But they are growing stronger by the day and Harry is running out of time …

                            Secrets and suspicion are spreading through the wizarding world, and Hogwarts itself is not safe.
