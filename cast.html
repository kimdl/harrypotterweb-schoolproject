                                Though Radcliffe did not need to continue working after playing the one and only Harry Potter, 
                                the actor ended up having a very fruitful post-Potter career.
                                <br><br>
                                Radcliffe had great roles in The Woman in Black, Horns, What If, and Now You See Me 2. 
                                Outside of filmmaking the actor has also had a major theater career: He’s starred in
                                 Equus (Broadway), How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (Broadway), The 
                                 Cripple of Inishmann (on both Broadway and the West End), and The Lifespan of Fact 
                                 (Broadway).
                                <br><br>
                                In 2020 Daniel Radcliffe had roles in Escape from Pretoria, Miracle Workers, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: 
                                Kimmy vs the Reverend. So far it looks like he hasn’t signed on for any projects in 2021, 
                                however that’s most likely due to the current pandemic that has greatly affected the entertainment business.

                                Harry Potter is the main character of the entire Harry Potter series, 
                                hence the name on all the books. He was the only child of James and Lily Potter, 
                                who were members of the original Order of the Phoenix. When Voldemort (an evil wizard) 
                                killed his parents, baby Harry Potter was sent to live wit his muggle aunt and uncle 
                                who refused to tell him the truth about his family.
                                <br><br>
                                Years later, Harry Potter started to receive his letters from Hogwarts — 
                                and eventually learned the truth once Rubeus Hagrid came to find him. 
                                He had to no idea that he was known as the “Boy Who Lived” by the Wizarding world 
                                as the only sole survivor to the killing curse. He began attending Hogwarts School 
                                of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and his connection to Voldemort began to return.

                                <br>
                                Of the trio, Rupert Grint has been in the smallest projects after Harry Potter.
                                <br><br>
                                He’s appeared in several TV series including a pilot called Super Clyde, The ABC Murders, Snatch, and Sick Note. On the film side of his career he co-starred in Postman Pat and CBGB. He hasn’t totally left the world of HP — he’s contributed his voice to a couple of Wizarding World theme park projects at Universal.
                                <br><br>
                                Most recently he’s been starring on the television series Servant. In his personal life, Rupert Grint has been dating actress Georgia Groome since 2011 – and in 2020 the couple had a daughter together.

                            <h3>About: Ronald Weasley (character)</h3>
                            <p style="color: #000;">
                                <br>
                                Ronald Weasley, also known as Ron, is a pureblood wizard and the sixth child of Arthur and Molly Weasley. Unlike many other pureblood wizards in the series, his family isn’t well off and they are also friendly with muggles/muggle born wizards. His siblings include Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, and Ginny Weasley.
                                <br><br>
                                Harry Potter and Ron quickly became friends at Hogwarts where they were both sorted into Gryffindor House. They met Hermione Granger early on, but didn’t officially become friends with her until sometime later in the year after a bit of a rough patch with Ron.
                                <br>
                                However, once the three became friends they were inseparable. Ron’s greatest quality is perhaps his loyalty, much like his patronus which is a dog.

                                Watson hasn’t starred in as many films as Radcliffe did after Harry Potter, 
                                but she’s been involved with several high profile projects. She starred in the book-to-film
                                 adaptation of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Disney’s live-action re-telling of Beauty and the Beast,
                                  and The Bling Ring.
                                <br><br>
                                Following starring in the Harry Potter series, the actress also attended Brown University. 
                                She took some time off over the years in order to make room for acting projects, 
                                but eventually did graduate with an English literature degree in May of 2014.

                                In more recent years Emma Watson has devoted a lot of her time to activism and women’s rights work. 
                                She became the UN Women Global Goodwill Ambassador for HeForShe. She also began a feminist Goodreads book club titled 
                                Our Shared Shelf in 2016 to encourage the spread of feminism ideas. In 2019, she helped to set up Rights of Women, 
                                a legal hotline for people who have suffered sexual harassment at work.

                            <p style="color: #000;">
                                <br>
                                Hermione Jean Granger is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. 
                                She first appears in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as a new student on her way to Hogwarts.
                                <br><br>
                                Hermione's first name is taken from a character in William Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, 
                                though Rowling has said that the two characters have little to nothing in common otherwise. 
                                Rowling said that she wanted her name to be unusual since if fewer girls shared her name, 
                                fewer girls would get teased for it[13] and it seemed that "a pair of professional dentists, 
                                who liked to prove how clever they are...gave [her] an unusual name that no-one could pronounce."
                                 Her original last name was "Puckle", but Rowling felt the name "did not suit her at all", and so 
                                 the less frivolous Granger made it into the books and movies.

                                Despite not being one of the “big three,” Felton has had a great career in the years since the Potter films wrapped. He’s starred in Rise of the Planet of the Apes and the TV series Origin, plus he had a big role on The Flash season 3 as Julian Albert. He’s also kept up a busy fan convention schedule and has participated in numerous events surrounding the Harry Potter franchise, including several Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park attraction openings.

                                Bonnie Wright’s Ginny Weasley portrayal is definitely a source of debate within the Harry Potter fandom, but she has also kept busy post Potter. She’s starred in a few smaller movies, including a 2018 retelling of A Christmas Carol, but she’s also moved behind the camera and has written, directed and produced a few shorts.                                <br>
